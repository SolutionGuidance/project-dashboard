"Requirement ID Number";"Requirement Statement";"Comment" 
(CSV was exported with semi-colon separator, strings enclosed in quotes)

Note that this list does not include requirement rows that were
"hidden" in RTM.xlsx.  We later determined that the should be
included, but the repair process is easier if they're in a separate
file, so see [[file:hidden-RTM-rows.org][hidden-RTM-rows.org]].

The entire "psm-SQ-*" category is new (it has been added as a new
sheet in RTM.xlsx) and there are also some newly-created requirements
in existing categories.  See [[file:added-reqs.org][added-reqs.org]] for details.  The short
story is: some of the new reqs will likely go away because they are
redundant with reqs that we discovered later when we un-hid some rows.
For now, they are all listed at the end, after the "SQ" set, even
though in RTM.xlsx they have been added to appropriate sheets.

Very likely this whole file will go away soon.  We can now use the
[[file:show-reqs][show-reqs]] script in this directory to print out all the requirements
whenever we need, as long as the CSV exports in csv-exports/ are
up-to-date with RTM.xlsx.  So whatever unredundifiying we do, we
should just do it in RTM.xlsx (or whatever our master location for
reqs is), export all the sheets to CSV, and then use the CSV files to
port reqs to textual formats as needed.
