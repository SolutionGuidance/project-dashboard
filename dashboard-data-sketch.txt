In the JSON data, fields without values (e.g. startDate, or completedDate)
should be `null` which is JSON's way of representing absence of a value:

{
  startDate: null
}

And dates should be represented as strings in ISO 8601 format
(https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) which can readily be converted into JS
Date objects if needed:

{
  startDate: "2018-06-11"
}

Minimum precision for dates should be the day (as above), but hours and minutes
can also optionally be included:
{
  startDate: "2018-06-11T19:20+01:00"
}

Here is the full example of the shape of the data:

features: {
  "psm-feature-000": {
    description: String,
    status: String ['Complete', 'InProgress', 'NotStarted'],
    startDate: String[Date] or null,
    completedDate: String[Date] or null,
    requirements: [
      'psm-FR-8.2', 
      'psm-FR-8.3', 
      ...
    ]
  },
  "psm-feature-001": {
    ...
  }
}


requirements: {
  'psm-FR-8.2': {
    description: String,
    status: String ['Complete', 'InProgress', 'NotStarted'],
    startDate: String[Date] or null,
    completedDate: String[Date] or null,
    issues: [
      123,
      456,
      789,
      ...
    ]
  },
  'psm-FR-8.3': {
    ...
  },
  ...
}

issues : {
  123: {
    title: String,
    description: String,
    url: String,
    status: String ['Complete', 'InProgress', 'NotStarted'],
    startDate: String[Date] or null,
    completedDate: String[Date] or null,
  },
  456: {
    ...
  },
  ...
}
